🌍 AI-Driven Natural Disaster Alert & Rescue
🚨 Problem
When disasters strike, official reports are often too slow. A single tweet about a flood or earthquake can appear minutes before news broadcasts — but that signal is usually lost in noise. Lives are at risk when people don’t know where to go or how to stay safe.
